# 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted
## 描述
Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.


Example 1:

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
```

Constraints:
```
2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-1000 <= target <= 1000
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
```

## 题解
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = numbers.length-1;
        while ( l < r ) {
            if ( numbers[l] + numbers[r] < target ) {
                l += 1;
                continue;
            }
            if ( numbers[l] + numbers[r] == target ) {
                return new int[]{l+1, r+1};
            }
            if ( numbers[l] + numbers[r] > target ) {
                r -= 1;
                continue;
            }
        }
        
        return new int[0];
    }
}
```
## 小结
1. 双指针注意点: 指针初始位置 循环跳出条件 指针移动规则
2. 有序数组的双指针指向的元素的和可以形成一个BST
